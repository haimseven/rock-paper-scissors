# rock-paper-scissors

Project Summary:
The Rock, Paper, Scissors game is a simple JavaScript project that allows users to play the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game against a computer opponent. The project consists of two main functions: getComputerChoice, which randomly generates the computer's choice, and playRound, which determines the winner of a single round based on the user's and computer's choices. Additionally, a higher-level function named game orchestrates a best-of-five game, keeping score and determining the overall winner.

Key Components:
getComputerChoice Function:

Generates a random choice for the computer (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).
Utilizes the Math.random() function to generate a random number.
Maps the random number to one of the three choices using a switch statement.
playRound Function:

Takes two parameters (user's choice and computer's choice) to determine the winner of a single round.
Handles case-insensitivity for user input.
Checks for ties, player wins, and computer wins based on Rock, Paper, Scissors rules.
Returns a message indicating the outcome of the round.
game Function:

Initiates a best-of-five game using a loop (assumes knowledge of loops or suggests manual function calls if not).
Uses prompt() to get user input for each round.
Calls playRound for each round, updates scores, and logs the results.
Determines the overall winner based on the accumulated scores.
Project Analysis:
User Interaction: The project incorporates user interaction through the use of prompt() to gather user input. This provides a simple and direct way for users to participate in the game.

Randomization: The use of the getComputerChoice function ensures that the computer's choices are randomized, adding an element of unpredictability to the game.

Scoring System: The scoring system keeps track of the user's and computer's scores throughout the game, allowing for a determination of the overall winner after a set number of rounds.

Code Readability: The code is relatively clear and well-organized. Functions are appropriately named, and comments are provided to explain the purpose of each section.

Extensibility: The project is extensible, and additional features could be added, such as a graphical user interface (GUI), improved styling, or integration with a web application.

Educational Value: The project is suitable for learning the basics of JavaScript, including functions, conditionals, loops (if the user already knows about them), user input, and randomization.

Conclusion:
The Rock, Paper, Scissors game project is a beginner-friendly JavaScript exercise that combines user interaction, randomization, and simple logic to create an engaging and interactive game. It provides a solid foundation for learning and practicing fundamental JavaScript concepts in a fun and practical context.
